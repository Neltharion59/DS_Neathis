I may not reveal to you her name neither the crimes you have been banished for. But that matters not. The demons are walking these lands again. We have witnessed their passing and reacted. All leads suggested it was the local residents who must have summoned them. So I sent my children after them, to put an end to demon summonings. It was only when you struck lethal blows to the last of my children, a vision has shown me that the prison I vowed to safekeep for eternity has been broken open. The humans and the droog I attacked had no guilt in this matter. I know not when or why I was not able to see it earlier. Perhaps the prisoners control magic more powerful than I had anticipated. Of all my sisters, only I was conceited enough to bestow this task upon myself. Now, death is the only just punishment i may receive. You, child of another serpent mother, are to be my executioner. When you're done with me, you must set out to investigate the prison. Slay the three guardians in the caverns surrounding the pyramid. You are the only one aware, the only one capable. The balance of this world is in grave peril.";
