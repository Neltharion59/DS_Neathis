We only hunt wild game, and only as much as we need. It's the other pack. They are lead by a bloodthirsty alpha, and have become very fierce lately. They are very organized and are systematically cutting the village from its allies. They did not start by themselves however, there is a powerful sorcerer commanding them and guiding their steps. Now they are after us. We cannot tolerate destruction of the village, travellers and guards prevent the krug from leaving the mountains and wrecking this area. They would hunt out all the animals soon and we would starve. The other pack knows we would attack them from back if they tried to storm the village. If you want to help the village, help us fight them!";
