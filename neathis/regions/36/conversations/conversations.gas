In that case, the Cave of Passage would be the path you need to take. You just need to exist the castle and head west. The northern Cave of Garrison holds the ice army that is about to attack us. The Cave of passage is the one with much smaller number of inhabitants, but it has become the resting place of many heroes before you. The last time some made it through was twenty years ago, when the kingdom's army needed to march towards the northern lands. You are welcome to stay at the for as long as you need.
