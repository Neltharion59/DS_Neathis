They dwell these caves, and are as numerous as kingdom's armies. It won't take them long before they have the confidence to leave their caves, in one direction or another, but the consequences will be fatal. If you are going to push through, how about you take me with you? Perhaps we could decimate the trog population along the way. If we survive.";
