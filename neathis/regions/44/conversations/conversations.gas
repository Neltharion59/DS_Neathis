We managed to spawn minor demons outside our prison, but would have remained here for eternity if it was not for her and yours folly. You have slain some of us on your way here, but the more cunning ones slipped behind your back. The seck are free upon this world once again. Neathis, this pitiful kingdom, shall fall soon. Then we'll set for Lyottia, and then even further. We will even reach the land of Aranna, and succeed where Gom the Pathetic failed. Now face me, foolish mortal. And know that even if you defeat me, it is not within your powers to stop events you have already set in motion. The eastern kingdoms shall fall.";
