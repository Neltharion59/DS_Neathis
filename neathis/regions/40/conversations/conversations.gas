After we've had some violent demon encounters in the desert, a demon appeared in our temple and persuaded the priests that he betrayed his kin to help us. Since then, my brethren have been attacking all humans, dwarves and elves on sight. I feel the same terror as my brothers do upon the sight of demons, but trusting one of them over the people of Neathis is madness. I beg you, destroy the demon in our temple.
