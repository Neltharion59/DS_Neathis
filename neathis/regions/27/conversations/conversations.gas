The area behind us is cleared from local vermin, so feel free to relax in the hot pools. They are the reason our town was built in the first place. Unfortunately, due to the threat of undead hordes, you will not be able to leave the town in any other direction than the one you came from. You may also take the path on my right hand, but that territory is not considered to be part of the kingdom. It is not safe and moreover...unexplored.";
