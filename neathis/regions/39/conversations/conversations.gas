Perhaps I would have summoned a demon or two and bind them to my will, but that would be all, I swear it! Alas, the portal became much more powerful than I designed it to be, and swarm of demons poured out, not paying me an ounce of attention. I hid up here, in my tower, and lit these protective fires. I do not know whether it's these fires repelling them or they just are not interested in me, but I dare not to find out. The portal has been opened for weeks. No human mage ever created such a mighty portal, and as powerful as I believe myself to be, this is certainly beyond amount of power any human wizard could ever harness. There has to be some otherworldly interference here. Anyway, the demon armies pour out of the portal day and night. No force in this world could possible stop them. Well, this wold used to be nice. I shall harness as much power as I can and shift myself to another plane of being. I suggest you do the same.";
