My late father was a mighty warrior. He joined an adventuring party on a quest to hunt down a mighty basilisk in these parts. However, they never returned. I am not a fool, I know they must have been petrified by his deadly sight. I am here to make sure that beast is destroyed in his stead. It surely resides in the caverns ahead from here. I tried to make my first push, but the kell and the gorrack beat me back. I am recovering to make a move again. If you happen to travel in that direction and manage to destroy it, I won't object to it. I am practical, not one those honor-above-all types. Before you leave, how about trading a little?";
