The few of us who maintain the town are hiding in the inn and the smithy. Ice witches, ice flies and other trouble usually sneak into town. We cannot even leave our supplies outside, as they get stolen or destroyed every time. The only exception is the loner Lubosh. He does not like leaving his house, and likes visitors even less. His house is near the well, on the cliff. Best avoid it. Be sure to visit the smithy and the second floor in the inn, you can find the local merchants there.";
